# Tailwind CSS Laravel Mix Starter Project

We use this as a starter template to quickly develop static HTML pages with :
- TailwindCSS
- Laravel Mix (Webpack)
- PostCSS
- PostCSS Nested
- PurgeCSS

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install

   # Using Yarn
   yarn
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm run serve

   # Using Yarn
   yarn serve
   ```

   Now you should be able to see the project running at localhost:8080.

3. Open `public/index.html` in your editor and start experimenting!

Base Tailwind CSS file is under `/resources/assets/css/styles.css`  
Root HTML file is under `/public/index.html` 

## Building for production

```bash
# Using npm
npm run prod

# Using Yarn
yarn prod
```
